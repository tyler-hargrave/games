### Introduction

This is a relatively complicated DOM based game. Backgammon is a legendary game; but people rarely have a board playing around so this lets you play with a friend on the subway or against the computer. Admittedly the computer is not that clever!

### Continued Development

To continue the development of this game the computer player can be improved. As of now he (Frank) will make random moves. With any strategy you should be able to beat him; however if we start running some machine learning then maybe he will beat you in the future.
